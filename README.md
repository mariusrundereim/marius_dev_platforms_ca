# Event Management API

## Overview

Course Assignment for Development Platforms. Goal is to create and host a functional RESTful API.
Focus will be to understand datastores and backend solutions commonly used in a full-stack web development.
This project will demonstrate my ability to implement **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** REST endpoints.

## Learning outcomes

- Service and APIs used to deliver intergrated full-stack solutions.
- Processes and tools used in front-end projects with cloud-based backend platforms and self-hosted APIs.

## Stack

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- AWS EC2 (Hosting)
